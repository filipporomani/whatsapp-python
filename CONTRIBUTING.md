# How to contribute

First of all, thank you for considering contributing to this project! It's people like you that make it a reality and help me keep it alive and updated.

If you are unsure about anything, feel free to ask me. I am here to help you.

Any bug report, feature request, or code contribution is welcome. Here are some guidelines to help you get started.

## Submitting changes

Please open a [Pull Request](https://github.com/filipporomani/whatsapp-python/pull/new/master) with a list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). Make sure, if possible, that all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "feat: a brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."


  * This is an open source software. Keep in mind to make your code readable to others. It's sort of like driving a car: perhaps you love doing donuts when you're alone, but with passengers the goal is to make the ride as smooth as possible.

There isn't any other particular guideline, feel free to contribute!
