## Installation

To install the library you can either use pip (latest release version):

``pip install whatsapp-python``

You can also install the development GitHub version (always up to date, with the latest features and bug fixes):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/filipporomani/whatsapp.git
cd whatsapp
pip install .
```

If you want to use a local enviroment you can also use hatch:
  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/filipporomani/whatsapp.git
cd whatsapp
pip install hatch
hatch shell
```

Documentation is available in the [wiki](https://github.com/filipporomani/whatsapp/wiki) here on GitHub.

## Why choose this library?

The main reason why I decided to fork the original `heyoo` library is that it uses an old version of the API, it's missing many and it's not mantained anymore.

In this fork I added app events (to listen to incoming messages) and implemented an easier way to send/receive messages and media by using the `Message` object.
The API version is always up to date and I'm always adding new features and fixing bugs.

I also added a full asyncronous version of the library, which is faster and more efficient than the syncronous one.

I fixed some bugs and added many features, however the library can still be improved.

### Supported features:

- Listening to events (messages, media, etc.)
- Async version available
- Sending messages
- Sending messages from different numbers individually
- Marking messages as read
- Replying to messages
- Reacting to messages
- Sending Media (images, audio, video and documents)
- Sending location
- Sending interactive buttons
- Sending template messages
- Parsing messages and media received
- Sending contacts

## Obtaining the WhatsApp API credentials

To use the WhatsApp API you need to create a Facebook Business account and a WhatsApp Business account.

> [!TIP]  
> To create an account, I recommend to follow [this video](https://youtu.be/d6lNxP2gadA).

## Pricing of the API

Whereas using third-party providers of the WhatsApp API can result in monthly fees, using the WhatsApp API[^1] offered directly by Facebook is much cheaper, even if the billing documentation is quite difficult to understand.

> [!CAUTION]  
> It is now mandatory to add a credit card to the WhatsApp account (at least for me) in order to use the service. I was even charged a tiny fee for using a non-test phone number (~â‚¬1.20), so be careful when using the API! I'm not responsible for any costs you may face by using the API.
>
> The API should be, however, free for testing purposes with the provided test phone number.

All the prices are available in the [**WhatsApp API docs**](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/pricing).

> [!TIP]  
> I recomend to use a test number, as you you can get a free one and use it for testing purposes.

## Migrating from `Neurotech-HQ/heyoo`

*You can ignore this if it's your first time using the library.*

- Any version >1.1.2 is incompatible with the original `heyoo` library! Be careful updating! Read the docs first!
- Any version <=1.1.2 is fully compatible with the original `heyoo` library and doesn't include breaking changes.

Switching from heyoo to whatsapp-python doesn't require any change for versions up to 1.1.2: just uninstall `heyoo`, install `whatsapp-python==1.1.2` and change the import name from `heyoo` to `whatsapp`.

For versions GREATER THAN 1.1.2, messages have became objects, so you need to change your code to use the new methods.

> [!NOTE]  
> Documentation for version 1.1.2 can be found [here](https://github.com/filipporomani/whatsapp/wiki/v1.1.2).
